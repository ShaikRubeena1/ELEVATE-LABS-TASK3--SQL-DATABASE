Retail Sales Data Analysis (SQL Project)


Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a retail sales dataset using SQL. The dataset consists of multiple related tables including sales, customers, channels, and products. The goal is to generate insights about customer purchasing behavior, product performance across sales channels, and average transaction values.

Objective
The main objectives of this analysis include:

Identifying top-performing customers and products based on total revenue.

Analyzing customer purchase patterns such as average line totals and unit prices.

Evaluating channel-specific performance (e.g., "Wholesale", "Distributor").

Filtering key insights like high-value purchases or specific channel activity.

Key SQL Tasks

Total Revenue by Channel, Customer, and Product

Used JOINs across sales, customer, channel, and product tables.

Aggregated total revenue using SUM(LineTotal * OrderQuantity).

Ordered results by total revenue in descending order.

Top 10 Customers by Average Spend

Calculated average LineTotal and UnitPrice per customer.

Highlighted the most valuable customers by average spend.

Average Purchase Amount in Wholesale Channel

Focused on the "Wholesale" sales channel.

Aggregated average LineTotal by channel and product.

Top 5 High-Value Transactions in Distributor Channel

Filtered by ChannelName = 'Distributor' or LineTotal > 5000.

Returned top 5 transactions with the highest LineTotal.

Tools Used
